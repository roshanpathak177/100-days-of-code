# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 18 Aug 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Committed Publically. Wrote a mission statement that i would read before starting to code, as Simon Sinek says- Start With Why. Then brushed-up Git and Markdown. 

**Thoughts:** Didn't care much about unpreparedness, went in anyway. Feeling Exciting and How I'm about to Use my time Productively.
